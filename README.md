# advent-of-code

I decided to put all of my AoC solutions into one repo. I use different programming languages for different years.
I will do as many assignments as I can, but it has to stay fun :) So usually I don't finish the entire month.

Any custom run instructions will be in the README of the year. I will not maintain / update older years to keep them
running.
